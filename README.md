Problem: Despite the abundance of food in many communities, hunger remains a persistent issue, with millions of people suffering from food insecurity on a daily basis. At the same time, there is a surplus of food waste, with perfectly good food being thrown away or going to waste due to various reasons.

Objective: The aim of this food donation app is to bridge the gap between food surplus and food insecurity, by making it easier for individuals and organizations to donate food to those in need. By providing an intuitive platform for food donations, and connecting donors with nearby food donation centers, the app will help reduce food waste and fight hunger in local communities.

Solution: The food donation app provides a comprehensive solution to the issue of food waste and hunger. The app's two main features - food donation and center locator - work together to address the problem in the following ways:

Food Donation: By providing a simple and convenient platform for food donations, the app makes it easy for individuals and organizations to donate excess food to those in need. The app's user-friendly form for food donations ensures that the information provided is accurate and complete, which can help streamline the donation process and make it more efficient.

Center Locator: The app's center locator feature helps connect donors with nearby food donation centers, making it easier for them to find places to donate their excess food. This feature helps reduce food waste by ensuring that surplus food gets to those who need it, rather than going to waste.

By providing a simple and effective solution to the problem of food waste and hunger, the food donation app has the potential to make a significant impact in local communities and beyond.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
